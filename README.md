# Programming: Principles and Practice - A Diary

### What is it about?
This repository is an online journal where I keep track of my progress while working through PPP by Bjarne Stroustrup in order
to learn C++. This is supposed to track my progress. 

### Structure
I have split the repository in three main folders: 

- **Chapters:** 
This is where I code along while reading through the chapters. This is going to be very close to the code in the book. I plan
to include a README for every chapter where I leave notes about what has been covered in the chapter. 

- **Drills:** 
The drills covers the code written while working through the must-do exercises at the end of each chapter. 

- **Exercises:** 
The exercises folder covers the code written for the voluntary exercises at the end of each chapter.
