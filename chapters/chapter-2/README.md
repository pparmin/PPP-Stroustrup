# Outcomes

The biggest issue in this chapter was not the code, as this was quite straightforward for me coming from Javascript & PHP. However, the book made it abundandly clear that the goal of this chapter was to set up the environment. Therefore I was forced to learn the basics of CMake, a very common (cross-platform) build system for C++, that makes use of the compiler (Clang)  to compile the source code and then links the different Object files to create an executable. 

The CMake file you find here includes the most basic instructions neccessary to build and execute simple programs.
