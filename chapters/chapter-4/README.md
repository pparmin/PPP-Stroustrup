# Outcomes

The fourth chapter covered the basic nuts and bolts for writing a program. It introduced to such important elements as functions
and data storages (vectors). The fourth chapter certainly was an interesting experience, especially due to the exercises that took
me quite a while to finish, as I was unfortunately very busy while doing them. I had set myself to solve them all though so that's
what I did.
