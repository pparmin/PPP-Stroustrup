# Outcomes

I did really appreciate the focus on error handling. I've been wanting to get a better idea of how to use try-catch statements. 
Writing a simple error() function that throws a run_time error is such a simple and yet effective way to end a program with
erroneous input. I am definitely starting to see the benefits of the strong focus on proper design techniques that this book
constantly wants to raise.
