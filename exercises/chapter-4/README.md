# Overview 

There were a lot of exercises at the end of this chapter and I am happy that I fulfilled my initial plan to solve almost all of them.
The exercises included in this chapter and solved by me are:

- Exercise 2: Median Calculator
- Exercise 3: Distance Calculator
- Exercise 4: Number guessing game
- Exercise 5: Simple calculator
- Exercise 6: Digit-to-spelled-out converter
- Exercise 8 & 9: Grains of Rice
- Exercise 10: Rock-Paper-Scissors
- Exercise 11 & 12: Find all primes in a range
- Exercise 13 & 14 & 15: The Sieve of Erastothenes
- Exercise 18: Quadratic Equation solver
- Exercise 19: Name-value pairs

The only exercise I skipped was the calculation of the min, max and mode of a sequence of strings. At the end of the exercises I just 
wanted to continue as I had been spending quite some time to practice the fundamentals behind these exercises, but I wanted to move on,
so I chose the remaining exercises according to their interest to me. 

This post concludes with a description that I had written right after solving two of the exercises that seemed the hardest or 
most fun to me:

**Rock Paper Scissors**

Definitely one of my favourite exercises in this chapter was the
Rock, Paper, Scissors game. That is mostly due to the fact that I
already made a browser based version of this simple game. It was 
interesting to compare both approaches (Javascript & C++). 

**The Sieve of Erastothenes**

The "Sieve of Erastothenes" is an ancient method for finding prime numbers in a specific range. Basically, one makes
a list of all numbers within that range and then iteratively removes all multiples of each prime until there's no 
multiples left. For more information, see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes. I haven't yet 
figured out a recursive approach to this, which results in the current program being a bit less elegant, since I have
to manually make the calls.
