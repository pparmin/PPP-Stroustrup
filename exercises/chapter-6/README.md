# Overview

This README file is both for chapter 6 and chapter 7. 

Both chapter 6 & 7 have been a really hard struggle for me for quite a long time. This chapter is where Bjarne throws you into the deep end by introducing both classes and more advanced concepts of computer science, such as grammars and syntax. 

What you build here, in a very basic way, is nothing short of a parser. In this case all that is being parsed are basic arithmetic operations. And yet, you will still
have to understand the process of Tokens and how to read them and work with them.

I have to say that working on those two chapters has really pushed me forward quite significantly. I am starting to see the first fruits of my labour with this book.
